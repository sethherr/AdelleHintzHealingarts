    <div class="about-text">
      <p>I began my study of massage and bodywork in 2009, in Portland Oregon, graduating from East West College of the Healing Arts to become a professional massage therapist. I moved to  Oakland California in 2013, in search of blue skies and sunshine.  I am an avid cyclist with a background in martial arts and yoga. I am passionate about creating a supportive community by facilitating wellness through therapeutic human touch and I am committed to an open and inviting atmosphere using honest and constructive communication.</p>
      <p>I specialize in Therapeutic Massage, Sports Massage and Deep Relaxation, using my combined training in Western and Eastern modalities that include Acupressure, Deep Tissue, and Swedish Massage techniques.</p>
      <p>I offer a safe space to all genders and identities including religious and ethnic.  And am committed to using only cruelty free products.</p>
